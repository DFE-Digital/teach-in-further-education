  :title: Choosing a teaching qualification
  :advice_body: |-
    Which course you choose will depend on your own circumstances and considerations such as:
    - cost and time commitment
    - expectations of specific FE providers you want to work for
    - your existing knowledge (some people take an introductory course first)

    Most courses allow full or part time study and there are bursaries and scholarships available for some qualifications.

    ### Working in FE without a teaching qualification

    The qualifications needed for specific teaching roles in FE are set by each employer. This means you might be able to work in FE without a teaching qualification. However, you’re likely to be expected to study for a qualification while you work if you don’t have one already.

    ### Subject knowledge and skills

    As well as a teaching qualification you need knowledge or skills in the subject you want to teach in FE. You usually need a Level 3 qualification in your subject areas, such as an A Level.

    ### Introductory qualifications
    You might choose one of these qualifications if you are considering teaching in FE and want to build your knowledge with a shorter introductory course.

    __These are not full teaching qualifications.__ You will usually need additional qualifications and experience before you can teach.
