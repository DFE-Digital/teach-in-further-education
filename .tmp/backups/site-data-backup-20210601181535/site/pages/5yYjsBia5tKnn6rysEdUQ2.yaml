      Lectures and training takes place in colleges, training centres and on-site in industry settings. FE allows experts in their subject to pass on knowledge and inspire people of a range of ages and backgrounds.

    :title: Find a job
    :advice_body: "If you know of any local FE colleges, have a look on their websites
      to see if there are any suitable vacancies.\n\nNot all colleges say if qualification
      training is included on their job adverts. They will specify the qualification
      needed for the job though. \n\nIf you decide to get qualified first, you'll
      at least know what course you need to take. \n\nIt's worth getting in touch
      with the college by email if you're not sure. \n\nIf a college needs your expertise,
      they may encourage you to gain a teaching qualification while you’re working
      for them. They might even help to find and pay for the course.\n\nOther places
      to look:\n- [Association of colleges job site](https://www.aocjobs.com \"Association
      of Colleges jobs\")\n- [Further Education job site](https://www.fejobs.com/career-advice
