      :title: Choosing a teaching qualification
      :advice_body: |-
        Which course you choose will depend on your own circumstances and considerations such as:
        - cost and time commitment
        - expectations of specific FE providers you want to work for
        - your existing knowledge (some people take an introductory course first)

        Most courses allow full or part time study and there are bursaries and scholarships available for some qualifications.

        ### Working in FE without a teaching qualification

        The qualifications needed for specific teaching roles in FE are set by each employer. This means you might be able to work in FE without a teaching qualification. However, you’re likely to be expected to study for a qualification while you work if you don’t have one already.

        ### Subject knowledge and skills

        As well as a teaching qualification you need knowledge or skills in the subject you want to teach in FE. You usually need a Level 3 qualification in your subject areas, such as an A Level.

        ### Introductory qualifications
        You might choose one of these qualifications if you are considering teaching in FE and want to build your knowledge with a shorter introductory course.

        __These are not full teaching qualifications.__ You will usually need additional qualifications and experience before you can teach.

    :title: FE providers are independent organisations
    :advice_body: |
      FE providers like colleges and universities can:
      - set their own requirements in terms of qualifications and experience
      - have their own pay structure and other terms and conditions

      This means that you will need to make your own assessment of any FE provider you consider applying to work for.
