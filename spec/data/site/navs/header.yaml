    :title: What is further education?
    :advice_body: "Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:\n\n- learn
      a skill or trade\n- study a vocational subject\n- develop their professional
      career\n- complete post-16 academic studies\n- study as part of an apprenticeship\n\nAs
      an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people
      and adults.\n\nIf teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical
      settings than in a classroom.\n\n## Where you could work\n\nPlaces where FE
      teachers work include:\n\n- local colleges\n- independent training providers\n-
      workplaces\n- prisons\n\nFE is not the same as:\n\n- higher education (university)\n-
      secondary (high school and sixth form)\n\n## What you could teach\n\nFE colleges
      and training providers teach a huge range of subjects, from brick laying to
      beauty therapy.\n\nOften the subjects taught reflect the needs of the local
      economy.\n\nThe courses taught include:\n\n- GCSEs\n- T Levels (a new qualification,
      considered a vocational equivalent to an A Level)\n- BTECs\n- Apprenticeships\n-
      Diplomas\n\n### Teaching skills and trades\n\nYou need to have practical knowledge
      of the trade or skill you want to teach.\n\nSome FE colleges and training providers
      want teachers to have a qualification in their skill or trade.\n\n[If you have
      significant career experience, you may be able to start teaching with an FE
      provider.](/train-on-the-job.html \"Train on the job\")\n\nCareer experience
      includes working in offices, laboratories and other settings.\n\nSoft skills
      gained through years of employment will also help you as a teacher.\n\n####
      Subject areas\n\nThere are too many subject areas to list them all. \n\nHere's
      a sample list of some of the sectors covered by FE teaching:\n\n- agriculture,
      environment and animal care\n- business, administration and office management\n-
      catering and hospitality\n- childcare and education\n- construction\n- creative
      and design\n- digital and IT\n- emergency and armed services\n- engineering
      and manufacturing\n- hair and beauty\n- health and life sciences\n- legal, finance
      and accounting\n- sales, marketing and procurement\n- social care\n- transport
      and logistics\n\n### Teaching academic subjects\n\nYou could teach in subjects
      like:\n\n- English\n- mathematics\n- science\n- social sciences\n- humanities\n-
      modern foreign languages\n- art and design\n- performing arts\n\nYou will need
      at least an A level or equivalent qualification in your subject to teach it
      in in FE. As a rule you need to be qualified at least 1 level above that you
      want to teach.\n\nFor example, to teach GCSE English, you need to have an A
      level in the subject.\n\nSome colleges and training providers may encourage
      you to undertake teacher training. This might help you to start to teach in
      the future if that's what you want to do.\n\n## What teaching in further education
      is like\n\nTeaching in FE can be challenging, but also rewarding.\n\nYou'll
      be passing on your skills, knowledge and experience to improve students' prospects.\n\nYou'll
      be making a difference to your students' lives, but you'll work hard for it.\n\nAside
      from teaching, you'll mark and assess your students' work.\n\nYou'll be there
      to support them not just with their learning, but with pastoral issues too.\n\n##
      Work part-time or full-time\n\nThere are full- and part-time jobs in FE. If
      you need to do teacher training, some courses are flexible too.\n\nFurther education
      teachers are employed by the college or training provider.\n\n## Non-teaching
      roles\n\nYou can work in FE without any teacher training.\n\nFor example you
      can work as a:\n\n- technician\n- teaching assistant\n- learning support assistant\n"

          John, Lecturer in Plumbing

          ## How did you get into further education teaching?

          I was looking for a change of career after 35 years as a plumber. I'm not getting any younger and I also wanted a break from chasing new business and payments.

          A friend of mine suggested that I teach plumbing at the college she works at, and that's what got me thinking. I did take a month or two off though to do up the house.

          The college were keen to take me on as I already had a professional qualification. I'm doing my teaching qualification in my spare time so that I'll be a qualified teacher by the end of the year.

        :advice_body: "## What does your day look like?\n\nMost of my teaching is
          done in the workshop as mine's a very practical subject.\n\nSome of the
          work is classroom based, like teaching the students how to price up a job
          and sort out their tax.\n\nSome of the classes are in the evening, so my
          days are quite flexible. \n\nApart from that I might be planning a lesson,
          assessing the students' work, or helping a student who's having problems.\n\nThe
          college takes the pastoral stuff very seriously, so we're all expected to
          help the students with any problems they have - in or out of college.\n\nSome
          days can be really busy though, and I do not often leave bang on time.\n\n##
          What do you enjoy about working in further education?\n\nI still feel like
          I'm in the plumbing trade, which is important to me as I've been a plumber
          since I left school.\n\nI like the fact that I'm bringing new people into
          the trade. Some of them didn't do so well with regular school, but I'm giving
          them the chance to go out and earn a living.\n\nBecause I'm teaching now,
          some of my old plumbing mates think I'm a bit of a guru!"

      :title: What you need to teach in further education
      :advice_body: "There are 2 elements that make a good further education (FE)
        teacher:\n\n- skills, knowledge and experience in your subject\n- effective
        teaching practice\n\nIdeally you'll have industry experience, preferably with
        relevant trade qualification. Usually at level 3.\n\n[What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
        \"what different academic levels mean\")\n\nYou'll also need good mathematics
        and English skills.\n\nTeaching practice forms part of teacher training, which
        your college or training provider will support you to do.\n\nThis is not linked
        to what you want to teach. It's to help you to teach anything your skills,
        knowledge and experience qualify you to.\n\nYou'll need to study teacher training.
        \n\nThere are 2 ways of doing teacher training:\n\n- [Train on the job](/train-on-the-job.html
        \"Train on the job\")\n- [Train in your own time](/train-in-your-own-time.html
        \"Train in your own time\")\n\nIf you need teacher training your new employer
        will arrange this for you.\n\nTeacher training courses vary by:\n\n- what
        they cost\n- their duration\n- their minimum qualification requirements\n\n[Here's
        a list of popular teacher training courses.](/full-list-of-fe-qualifications.html

      :title: Pay, conditions, and benefits
      :advice_body: "### What you could earn\n\nFurther education (FE) teachers are
        employed by colleges and training providers on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n[According
        to the National Careers Service the average salary for an FE teacher ranges
        from £24,000 to £37,000. ](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/further-education-lecturer
        \"National Careers Service\")\n\nFE providers are independent businesses,
        so are free to set their own salary levels.\n\nThese may be determined by:\n\n-
        the demand for your subject\n- your level of experience and qualifications\n-
        your local area\n\nYou can get an idea of your local provider's pay scale
        by looking at the current jobs on the careers section of their website.\n\n[Find
        your local FE college on the Association of Colleges website](https://www.aocjobs.com/employers-a-z

        providers on the Association of Employment Learning Providers' website](https://www.aelp.org.uk/about/our-members/
        \"Association of Employment Learning Providers member finder\")\n\n### Benefits
        package\n\nFE providers are employers like any other in the private sector,
        and often offer a range of benefits on top of the salary.\n\nThese may include:\n\n-
        pension schemes\n- childcare vouchers\n- cycle to work schemes\n- discount
        gym memberships\n\nThis is not a complete list. You'll find what each FE provider
        offers on their website.\n\n### Working hours\n\nA full-time FE teacher is
        typically contracted to 35-37 hours a week. Some teaching goes on in the evening,
        so your working day can be flexible.\n\nMany FE teachers work part time to
        fit around other commitments.\n\nLook at the jobs in the careers section of
        the provider's website to give yourself an idea of how flexible they are.\n\n###
        Holidays \n\nAs an employee you are entitled to paid holidays.\n\nTerm-based
        holidays mean college-based FE teachers typically get 37 days' paid leave
        per year, plus all the bank holidays.\n\nIndependent training providers do
        not usually follow the college terms, so leave can be taken at any time. The
        amount of leave offered varies by provider.\n\n### Career progression\n\nThere
        are plenty of opportunities to further your career in FE.\n\n#### For example:\n\n-
        become an assessor\n- lead your subject area\n- increase your profile in your
        industry\n\nFE providers are independent organisations, so career paths available
        may vary.\n\nSpeak to your local college or training provider, or visit their
        careers website to get an idea of what other roles they recruit.\n\n[Find
        your local FE college on the Association of Colleges website](https://www.aocjobs.com/employers-a-z

          Sarah, Lecturer in Mathematics

          ## How did you get into further education teaching?

          I'd finished my maternity leave from the high school I taught in, and decided that the rigid school day was a problem. I asked if I could work part-time, but was told it was not possible.

          I looked online and found that a local college was advertising for a maths lecturer. The job was full time, but with some evening work, so the kids could spend less time in nursery and after school clubs.

          The job paid about the same, although with a shorter commute and less childcare to pay for, it made sense to apply.

          I got an interview, was offered a job, and the rest is history.

          ## What do you enjoy about working in further education?

          I love the flexibility that comes with the job. I can go for a bike ride or a swim in the morning  some days as my classes are in the afternoon and evening.

          That’s not to say that it’s all easy. There’s always marking to do and sometimes you have to either stay late or take it home with you.

          It's also refreshing to be teaching students who really want to learn. A lot of them have to pass maths GCSE to help them improve their employability, so are really keen to do well.

          Some of the students just need remedial maths to help them with other courses. If they are learning a trade, a bit of maths makes the financial side of things easier to understand.

          There's also a different vibe in the staff room. A lot of the other lecturers had other jobs before and have interesting stories to tell.

      If you have the skills, knowledge and experience the college or training provider wants, you can start work as an FE teacher.

      You'll study for your teacher training alongside your work as a teacher. Colleges and training providers may give you time to study during working hours.

      [Here's a list of popular teacher training courses.](/full-list-of-fe-qualifications.html "A list of popular teacher training courses")

      The FE provider may pay for your teacher training. If so, they may expect you to stay with them for a set period after you qualify.

      [You may be eligible to apply for a student loan to help pay for the course fees.](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance "Student loans")

      If you want to start teaching in FE before you get a teaching qualification, you do not need to worry about courses.

      The college or training provider will arrange the teacher training course for you.

      If you want to train first, you need to know what training options there are.

      Which course you choose will depend on the:

      - course costs
      - time you can commit
      - expectations of the FE providers you want to work for
      - qualifications you already have

      Some teaching courses allow full or part time study.

      Unlike primary and secondary education, the FE sector is not regulated.

      FE providers like colleges and training providers can:

      - set their own requirements in terms of qualifications and experience
      - have their own pay structure and other terms and conditions

      This means that you will need to make your own assessment of any FE provider you consider applying to work for.
