    :title: What is further education?
    :advice_body: |-
      Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:

      - learn a skill or trade
      - study a vocational subject
      - develop their professional career
      - complete post-16 academic studies
      - study as part of an apprenticeship

      As an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults.

      If teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical settings than in a classroom.

      providers on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n### The average salary for an FE
      teacher ranges from £24,000 to £40,000 \n\nThis is according to National Careers
      Service figures.\n\nFE providers are independent businesses, so are free to
      set their own salary levels.\n\nThese may be determined by:\n\n- the demand

      need\n\n- skills, knowledge and experience in your subject\n- a teaching qualification

      preferably with relevant trade qualification. Usually at level 3.\n\n[What levels
      mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
      \"List of academic qualification levels\")\n\nYou'll also need mathematics and
      English skills. If you do not have GCSEs in mathematics and English, FE providers
      might want to assess your skills. They may support you to improve your mathematics
      and English skills as part of your teacher training.\n\n### Teacher training
      \n\nThe college or training provider will arrange this for you when you start
      a job with them.\n\nThe training is not linked to your subject or skill. It's
      to help you to share your skills, knowledge and experience.\n\nTeacher training
      courses vary by:\n\n- what they cost\n- their duration\n- their minimum qualification

    :title: What teaching in further education is like
    :advice_body: |-
      Teaching in FE can be challenging, but also rewarding.

      You'll be passing on your skills, knowledge and experience to improve students' prospects.

      You'll be making a difference to your students' lives, but you'll work hard for it.

      Aside from teaching, you'll mark and assess your students' work.

      You'll be there to support them not just with their learning, but with pastoral issues too.

        is suitable for those with industry experience. FE providers value industry

        qualifications needed for specific teaching roles in FE are set by the colleges
        and training providers.\n\nYou might be able to start work in FE without a
        teaching qualification.\n\nIf you are training as part of a job in a college
        or training provider, they may specify what course you need to do. This information
        may be on the job advert on their website.\n\n#### Other qualifications needed\n\nIdeally
        you'll have a level 3 qualification in your area of expertise.\n\n[What levels

    :title: Training on the job
    :advice_body: |-
      You can start work as an FE teacher straight away. As long as you have the right:

      - practical skills
      - knowledge of your subject
      - experience of your industry

      There are 2 ways to train when you start a teaching job with a college or training provider:

      - a teaching course, such as a Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training
      - an FE teaching apprenticeship

      Colleges and training providers decide themselves how to train new members of staff.

      ### How does this work?

      With either of the methods above you will:

      - be paid the training provider's going rate for an FE teacher
      - remain a member of the permanent staff when you pass the course
      - become a qualified FE teacher when you pass the course
      - get guaranteed time off the job to study

      The FE teaching apprenticeship has recently been revised and updated. It is designed to increase the quality of FE teacher training provision. It also lets FE providers access money to fund teacher training.

    :advice_body: |-
      You can do your teacher training in your own time around your own commitments.

      Different qualification levels are available. You do not need a degree to teach in FE, but having one gives you more options.

      [Here's a list of popular teacher training courses](/full-list-of-fe-qualifications.html "List of popular teaching courses")

      Once you have qualified you can apply for any suitable jobs.

      ### This may be the best approach if:

      - you want to train around existing commitments
      - you do not want to be tied-in to any one provider once you've qualified
      - you want to get a taste for FE before you commit to teaching in it

      You may be eligible to apply for a student loan to help pay for the course fees and living expenses.
      [Visit the student finance website](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance "Student loans")

      ### This might not be the right approach if:

      - you do not want to pay for your teacher training course yourself
      - there is a suitable vacancy at your local college or training provider
      - you're keen to start your new career as soon as a vacancy comes up

    :title: Choose your teaching qualification
    :advice_body: |
      If you want to start teaching in FE before you get a teaching qualification, you do not need to worry about courses.

      The college or training provider will arrange the teacher training course for you.

      If you want to train first, you need to know what training options there are.

      Which course you choose will depend on the:

      - course costs
      - time you can commit
      - expectations of the FE providers you want to work for
      - qualifications you already have

      Some teaching courses allow full or part time study.

    :advice_body: |
      FE providers like colleges and training providers can:

      - set their own requirements in terms of qualifications and experience
      - have their own pay structure and other terms and conditions

      This means that you will need to make your own assessment of any FE provider you consider applying to work for.

    :title: More than just colleges
    :advice_body: |-
      FE includes establishments that typically teach students aged 16+. Although this does not include universities, it does include independent training providers (ITPs).

      Like colleges, some ITPs will provide teacher training on the job. They may differ from colleges in other ways:

      - a more commercial focus
      - greater use of remote working
      - be industry sector specific

      IPTs do not follow the academic year, so you can take holiday leave at any time. The amount of holiday leave available will depend on the ITP. It is likely to be less than you'd get from a college, but more flexible about when you take it.

      Some job vacancies will have 'teacher' in the job title. You may find vacancies with different job titles that mean the same thing:

      - lecturer
      - tutor
      - skills trainer
      - skills coach

      Always read job adverts carefully, and read any downloadable job descriptions provided.

      If you're not sure about something, get in touch with the FE provider before you apply.

      Service figures.\n\nFE providers are independent businesses, so are free to
      set their own salary levels.\n\nThese may be determined by:\n\n- the demand
      for your subject\n- your level of experience and qualifications\n- your local
      area\n\nYou can get an idea of your local provider's pay scale by looking at

    :advice_body: "FE providers are employers like any other in the private sector,

      pension schemes\n- childcare vouchers\n- cycle to work schemes\n- discount gym
      memberships\n\nThis is not a complete list. You'll find what each FE provider
      offers on their website.\n\n### Working hours\n\nA full-time FE teacher is typically
      contracted to 35-37 hours a week. Some teaching goes on in the evening, so your
      working day can be flexible.\n\nMany FE teachers work part time to fit around
      other commitments.\n\nLook at the jobs in the careers section of the provider's
      website to give yourself an idea of how flexible they are.\n\n### Holidays \n\nAs
      an employee you are entitled to paid holidays.\n\nTerm-based holidays mean college-based
      FE teachers typically get 37 days' paid leave per year, plus all the bank holidays.\n\nIndependent
      training providers do not usually follow the college terms, so leave can be
      taken at any time. The amount of leave offered varies by provider."
