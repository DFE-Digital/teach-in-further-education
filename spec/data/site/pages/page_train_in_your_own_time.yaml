    You can do your teacher training in your own time around your own commitments.

    Different qualification levels are available. You do not need a degree to teach in FE, but having one gives you more options.

    [Here's a list of popular teacher training courses](/full-list-of-fe-qualifications.html "List of popular teaching courses")

    Once you have qualified you can apply for any suitable jobs.

    ## This may be the best approach if:

    - you want to train around existing commitments
    - you do not want to be tied-in to any one provider once you've qualified
    - you want to get a taste for FE before you commit to teaching in it

    You may be eligible to apply for a student loan to help pay for the course fees and living expenses.
    [Visit the student finance website](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance "Student loans")

    ## This might not be the right approach if:

    - you do not want to pay for your teacher training course yourself
    - there is a suitable vacancy at your local college or training provider
    - you're keen to start your new career as soon as a vacancy comes up

  :title: Help with living expenses
  :advice_body: "## Help with living expenses\n\nBursaries are payments that can help
    with (but are not limited to) living expenses. Depending on your subject, you
    may be able to get a bursary with your teacher training course.\n\nThe bursary
    is worth £12,000 to £26,000 over the length of the course. \n\nFor example, if
    the course was 2 years in length, a £26,000 bursary would amount to £13,000 per
    year.\n\nA set number of bursaries are released each year. Your course provider
    will let you know if you are eligible.\n\n[Information about bursaries available
