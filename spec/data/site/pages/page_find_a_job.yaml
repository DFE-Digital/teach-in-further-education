  :title: FE providers are independent organisations
  :advice_body: |
    FE providers like colleges and training providers can:

    - set their own requirements in terms of qualifications and experience
    - have their own pay structure and other terms and conditions

    This means that you will need to make your own assessment of any FE provider you consider applying to work for.

  :title: More than just colleges
  :advice_body: |-
    FE includes establishments that typically teach students aged 16+. Although this does not include universities, it does include independent training providers (ITPs).

    Like colleges, some ITPs will provide teacher training on the job. They may differ from colleges in other ways:

    - a more commercial focus
    - greater use of remote working
    - be industry sector specific

    IPTs do not follow the academic year, so you can take holiday leave at any time. The amount of holiday leave available will depend on the ITP. It is likely to be less than you'd get from a college, but more flexible about when you take it.

  :title: What to look for
  :advice_body: |-
    Some job vacancies will have 'teacher' in the job title. You may find vacancies with different job titles that mean the same thing:

    - lecturer
    - tutor
    - skills trainer
    - skills coach

    Always read job adverts carefully, and read any downloadable job descriptions provided.

    If you're not sure about something, get in touch with the FE provider before you apply.

  :title: What you could earn
  :advice_body: "Further education (FE) teachers are employed by colleges and training
    providers on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n### The average salary for an FE teacher
    ranges from £24,000 to £40,000 \n\nThis is according to National Careers Service
    figures.\n\nFE providers are independent businesses, so are free to set their
    own salary levels.\n\nThese may be determined by:\n\n- the demand for your subject\n-
    your level of experience and qualifications\n- your local area\n\nYou can get
    an idea of your local provider's pay scale by looking at the current jobs on the
    careers section of their website.\n\n[Find your local FE college on the Association
    of Colleges website](https://www.aocjobs.com/employers-a-z \"Association of Colleges

  :title: Benefits package
  :advice_body: "FE providers are employers like any other in the private sector,
    and often offer a range of benefits on top of the salary.\n\nThese may include:\n\n-
    pension schemes\n- childcare vouchers\n- cycle to work schemes\n- discount gym
    memberships\n\nThis is not a complete list. You'll find what each FE provider
    offers on their website.\n\n### Working hours\n\nA full-time FE teacher is typically
    contracted to 35-37 hours a week. Some teaching goes on in the evening, so your
    working day can be flexible.\n\nMany FE teachers work part time to fit around
    other commitments.\n\nLook at the jobs in the careers section of the provider's
    website to give yourself an idea of how flexible they are.\n\n### Holidays \n\nAs
    an employee you are entitled to paid holidays.\n\nTerm-based holidays mean college-based
    FE teachers typically get 37 days' paid leave per year, plus all the bank holidays.\n\nIndependent
    training providers do not usually follow the college terms, so leave can be taken
    at any time. The amount of leave offered varies by provider."
