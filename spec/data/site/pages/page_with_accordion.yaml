    :title: What is further education?
    :advice_body: "Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:\n\n- learn
      a skill or trade\n- study a vocational subject\n- develop their professional
      career\n- complete post-16 academic studies\n- study as part of an apprenticeship\n\nAs
      an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people
      and adults. \n\nIf teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical
      settings than in a classroom.\n\n## Where you could work\n\nFE teaching usually
      takes place in local colleges. Other places where FE teaching goes on include:\n\n-
      adult education centres\n- workplaces\n- prisons\n\n## What you could teach\n\nFE
      colleges teach a huge range of subjects, from brick laying to beauty therapy.
      \n\nOften the subjects taught reflect the needs of the local economy."

    :title: Could I teach in further education?
    :advice_body: |
      ## Work part-time or full-time

      There are full- and part-time jobs in further education (FE), and if you need to earn a qualification, most courses are flexible too.

      ## Teach a skill or trade

      You need to have skills in or knowledge of the subject you want to teach.

      Many FE colleges and learning centres need teachers to have a Level 3 qualification, such as an NVQ, in their skills or trade.

      If you can demonstrate significant industry experience, you still may be able to teach in a college or learning centre.

      You might be able to start a job in FE without a teaching qualification. However, you’re likely to be expected to study for a teaching qualification while you work if you don’t have one already.

      ## Teach academic subjects

      You could teach subjects like:

      - mathematics
      - English
      - sciences
      - literacy
      - numeracy
      - English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)
      - Special Educational Needs (SEN)

      You will need at least a level 3 qualification, such as an A Level in your subject to teach it in a FE college.

      ## Non-teaching roles

      You can work in FE without a teaching qualification.

      For example you can work as a technician or teaching assistant.

      Some colleges may encourage you to take further qualifications. This might help you to start to teach in the future if that's what you want to do.

      ## How to get started

      There is no formal entry path. The best thing to do is to speak to your local FE college, or look out for job ads on their website.

      :advice_body: "John, Lecturer in Plumbing\n\n## How did you get into further
        education teaching?\n\nI was looking for a change of career after 35 years
        as a plumber. I'm not getting any younger and I also wanted a break from chasing
        new business and payments.\n\nA friend of mine suggested that I teach plumbing
        at the college she works at, and that's what got me thinking. I did take a
        month or two off though to do up the house.\n\nThe college were keen to take
        me on as I already had a professional qualification. I'm doing my teaching
        qualification in my spare time so that I'll be a qualified teacher by the
        end of the year.\n\n## What does your day look like?\n\nMost of my teaching
        is done in the workshop as mine's a very practical subject.\n\nSome of the
        work is classroom based, like teaching the students how to price up a job
        and sort out their tax.\n\nSome of the classes are in the evening, so my days
        are quite flexible. \n\nApart from that I might be planning a lesson, assessing
        the students' work, or helping a student who's having problems.\n\nThe college
        takes the pastoral stuff very seriously, so we're all expected to help the
        students with any problems they have - in or out of college.\n\nSome days
        can be really busy though, and I do not often leave bang on time.\n\n## What
        do you enjoy about working in further education?\n\nI still feel like I'm
        in the plumbing trade, which is important to me as I've been a plumber since
        I left school.\n\nI like the fact that I'm bringing new people into the trade.
        Some of them didn't do so well with regular school, but I'm giving them the
        chance to go out and earn a living.\n\nBecause I'm teaching now, some of my
        old plumbing mates think I'm a bit of a guru!"

        Sarah, Lecturer in Mathematics

        ## How did you get into further education teaching?

        I'd finished my maternity leave from the high school I taught in, and decided that the rigid school day was a problem. I asked if I could work part-time, but was told it was not possible.

        I looked online and found that a local college was advertising for a maths lecturer. The job was full time, but with some evening work, so the kids could spend less time in nursery and after school clubs.

        The job paid about the same, although with a shorter commute and less childcare to pay for, it made sense to apply.

        I got an interview, was offered a job, and the rest is history.

        ## What do you enjoy about working in further education?

        I love the flexibility that comes with the job. I can go for a bike ride or a swim in the morning  some days as my classes are in the afternoon and evening.

        That’s not to say that it’s all easy. There’s always marking to do and sometimes you have to either stay late or take it home with you.

        It's also refreshing to be teaching students who really want to learn. A lot of them have to pass maths GCSE to help them improve their employability, so are really keen to do well.

        Some of the students just need remedial maths to help them with other courses. If they are learning a trade, a bit of maths makes the financial side of things easier to understand.

        There's also a different vibe in the staff room. A lot of the other lecturers had other jobs before and have interesting stories to tell.
