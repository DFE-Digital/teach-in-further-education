  :title: What is further education?
  :advice_body: "Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:\n\n- learn a
    skill or trade\n- study a vocational subject\n- develop their professional career\n-
    complete post-16 academic studies\n- study as part of an apprenticeship\n\nAs
    an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people
    and adults.\n\nIf teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical
    settings than in a classroom.\n\n## Where you could work\n\nPlaces where FE teachers
    work include:\n\n- local colleges\n- independent training providers\n- workplaces\n-
    prisons\n\nFE is not the same as:\n\n- higher education (university)\n- secondary
    (high school and sixth form)\n\n## What you could teach\n\nFE colleges and training
    providers teach a huge range of subjects, from brick laying to beauty therapy.\n\nOften
    the subjects taught reflect the needs of the local economy.\n\nThe courses taught
    include:\n\n- GCSEs\n- T Levels (a new qualification, considered a vocational
    equivalent to an A Level)\n- BTECs\n- Apprenticeships\n- Diplomas\n\n### Teaching
    skills and trades\n\nYou need to have practical knowledge of the trade or skill
    you want to teach.\n\nSome FE colleges and training providers want teachers to
    have a qualification in their skill or trade.\n\n[If you have significant career
    experience, you may be able to start teaching with an FE provider](/train-on-the-job.html
    \"Train on the job\")\n\nCareer experience includes working in offices, laboratories
    and other settings.\n\nSoft skills gained through years of employment will also
    help you as a teacher.\n\n#### Subject areas\n\nThere are too many subject areas
    to list them all. \n\nHere's a sample list of some of the sectors covered by FE
    teaching:\n\n- agriculture, environment and animal care\n- business, administration
    and office management\n- catering and hospitality\n- childcare and education\n-
    construction\n- creative and design\n- digital and IT\n- emergency and armed services\n-
    engineering and manufacturing\n- hair and beauty\n- health and life sciences\n-
    legal, finance and accounting\n- sales, marketing and procurement\n- social care\n-
    transport and logistics\n\n### Teaching academic subjects\n\nYou could teach in
    subjects like:\n\n- English\n- mathematics\n- science\n- social sciences\n- humanities\n-
    modern foreign languages\n- art and design\n- performing arts\n\nYou will need
    at least an A level or equivalent qualification in your subject to teach it in
    in FE. As a rule you need to be qualified at least 1 level above that you want
    to teach.\n\nFor example, to teach GCSE English, you need to have an A level in
    the subject.\n\nSome colleges and training providers may encourage you to undertake
    teacher training. This might help you to start to teach in the future if that's
    what you want to do.\n\n## What teaching in further education is like\n\nTeaching
    in FE can be challenging, but also rewarding.\n\nYou'll be passing on your skills,
    knowledge and experience to improve students' prospects.\n\nYou'll be making a
    difference to your students' lives, but you'll work hard for it.\n\nAside from
    teaching, you'll mark and assess your students' work.\n\nYou'll be there to support
    them not just with their learning, but with pastoral issues too.\n\n## Work part-time
    or full-time\n\nThere are full- and part-time jobs in FE. If you need to do teacher
    training, some courses are flexible too.\n\nFurther education teachers are employed
    by the college or training provider.\n\n## Non-teaching roles\n\nYou can work
    in FE without any teacher training.\n\nFor example you can work as a:\n\n- technician\n-
    teaching assistant\n- learning support assistant\n"

        John, Lecturer in Plumbing

        ## How did you get into further education teaching?

        I was looking for a change of career after 35 years as a plumber. I'm not getting any younger and I also wanted a break from chasing new business and payments.

        A friend of mine suggested that I teach plumbing at the college she works at, and that's what got me thinking. I did take a month or two off though to do up the house.

        The college were keen to take me on as I already had a professional qualification. I'm doing my teaching qualification in my spare time so that I'll be a qualified teacher by the end of the year.

      :advice_body: "## What does your day look like?\n\nMost of my teaching is done
        in the workshop as mine's a very practical subject.\n\nSome of the work is
        classroom based, like teaching the students how to price up a job and sort
        out their tax.\n\nSome of the classes are in the evening, so my days are quite
        flexible. \n\nApart from that I might be planning a lesson, assessing the
        students' work, or helping a student who's having problems.\n\nThe college
        takes the pastoral stuff very seriously, so we're all expected to help the
        students with any problems they have - in or out of college.\n\nSome days
        can be really busy though, and I do not often leave bang on time.\n\n## What
        do you enjoy about working in further education?\n\nI still feel like I'm
        in the plumbing trade, which is important to me as I've been a plumber since
        I left school.\n\nI like the fact that I'm bringing new people into the trade.
        Some of them didn't do so well with regular school, but I'm giving them the
        chance to go out and earn a living.\n\nBecause I'm teaching now, some of my
        old plumbing mates think I'm a bit of a guru!"

    :title: What you need to teach in further education
    :advice_body: "There are 2 elements that make a good further education (FE) teacher:\n\n-
      skills, knowledge and experience in your subject\n- effective teaching practice\n\nIdeally
      you'll have industry experience, preferably with relevant trade qualification.
      Usually at level 3.\n\n[What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
      \"what different academic levels mean\")\n\nYou'll also need good mathematics
      and English skills.\n\nTeaching practice forms part of teacher training, which
      your college or training provider will support you to do.\n\nThis is not linked
      to what you want to teach. It's to help you to teach anything your skills, knowledge
      and experience qualify you to.\n\nYou'll need to study teacher training. \n\nThere
      are 2 ways of doing teacher training:\n\n- [Train on the job](/train-on-the-job.html
      \"Train on the job\")\n- [Train in your own time](/train-in-your-own-time.html
      \"Train in your own time\")\n\nIf you need teacher training your new employer
      will arrange this for you.\n\nTeacher training courses vary by:\n\n- what they
      cost\n- their duration\n- their minimum qualification requirements\n\n[Here's

    :title: Pay, conditions, and benefits
    :advice_body: "### What you could earn\n\nFurther education (FE) teachers are
      employed by colleges and training providers on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n[According
      to the National Careers Service the average salary for an FE teacher ranges
      from £24,000 to £37,000 ](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-profiles/further-education-lecturer
      \"National Careers Service\")\n\nFE providers are independent businesses, so
      are free to set their own salary levels.\n\nThese may be determined by:\n\n-
      the demand for your subject\n- your level of experience and qualifications\n-
      your local area\n\nYou can get an idea of your local provider's pay scale by
      looking at the current jobs on the careers section of their website.\n\n[Find
      your local FE college on the Association of Colleges website](https://www.aocjobs.com/employers-a-z

      on the Association of Employment Learning Providers' website](https://www.aelp.org.uk/about/our-members/
      \"Association of Employment Learning Providers member finder\")\n\n### Benefits
      package\n\nFE providers are employers like any other in the private sector,
      and often offer a range of benefits on top of the salary.\n\nThese may include:\n\n-
      pension schemes\n- childcare vouchers\n- cycle to work schemes\n- discount gym
      memberships\n\nThis is not a complete list. You'll find what each FE provider
      offers on their website.\n\n### Working hours\n\nA full-time FE teacher is typically
      contracted to 35-37 hours a week. Some teaching goes on in the evening, so your
      working day can be flexible.\n\nMany FE teachers work part time to fit around
      other commitments.\n\nLook at the jobs in the careers section of the provider's
      website to give yourself an idea of how flexible they are.\n\n### Holidays \n\nAs
      an employee you are entitled to paid holidays.\n\nTerm-based holidays mean college-based
      FE teachers typically get 37 days' paid leave per year, plus all the bank holidays.\n\nIndependent
      training providers do not usually follow the college terms, so leave can be
      taken at any time. The amount of leave offered varies by provider.\n\n### Career
      progression\n\nThere are plenty of opportunities to further your career in FE.\n\n####
      For example:\n\n- become an assessor\n- lead your subject area\n- increase your
      profile in your industry\n\nFE providers are independent organisations, so career
      paths available may vary.\n\nSpeak to your local college or training provider,
      or visit their careers website to get an idea of what other roles they recruit.\n\n[Find

        Sarah, Lecturer in Mathematics

        ## How did you get into further education teaching?

        I'd finished my maternity leave from the high school I taught in, and decided that the rigid school day was a problem. I asked if I could work part-time, but was told it was not possible.

        I looked online and found that a local college was advertising for a maths lecturer. The job was full time, but with some evening work, so the kids could spend less time in nursery and after school clubs.

        The job paid about the same, although with a shorter commute and less childcare to pay for, it made sense to apply.

        I got an interview, was offered a job, and the rest is history.

        ## What do you enjoy about working in further education?

        I love the flexibility that comes with the job. I can go for a bike ride or a swim in the morning  some days as my classes are in the afternoon and evening.

        That’s not to say that it’s all easy. There’s always marking to do and sometimes you have to either stay late or take it home with you.

        It's also refreshing to be teaching students who really want to learn. A lot of them have to pass maths GCSE to help them improve their employability, so are really keen to do well.

        Some of the students just need remedial maths to help them with other courses. If they are learning a trade, a bit of maths makes the financial side of things easier to understand.

        There's also a different vibe in the staff room. A lot of the other lecturers had other jobs before and have interesting stories to tell.
