  :title: Training on the job
  :advice_body: "If you have the kind of skills and experiences that are in demand,
    it’s possible to start a job without a teaching qualification.\n\nContacting an
    FE college or learning centre is a good place to start, or look for teaching jobs
    in your subject specialism. \n\nIf the college needs your expertise, they may
    encourage you to gain a teaching qualification while you’re working for them.
    \n\nThey might even help to find and pay for the course.\n\n[You may be eligible
    to apply for a student loan to help pay for the course fees.](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance
    \"Student loans\")\n\n[Find a job in FE on the Association of Colleges website](https://www.aocjobs.com/

  :title: Training before you apply for a job
  :advice_body: |-
    Training for your career in FE can be done part time or full time. Courses can be designed to suit your personal circumstances, but you may have to check with individual colleges to see what you need to study.

    You’ll hear this called ‘pre-service’ training and as it suggests, you have to complete the training before starting a job.
