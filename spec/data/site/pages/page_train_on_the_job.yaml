  :advice_body: |-
    You can start work as an FE teacher straight away. As long as you have the right:

    - practical skills
    - knowledge of your subject
    - experience of your industry

    There are 2 ways to train when you start a teaching job with a college or training provider:

    - a teaching course, such as a Level 5 Diploma in Education and Training
    - an FE teaching apprenticeship

    Colleges and training providers decide themselves how to train new members of staff.

    ### How does this work?

    With either of the methods above you will:

    - be paid the training provider's going rate for an FE teacher
    - remain a member of the permanent staff when you pass the course
    - become a qualified FE teacher when you pass the course
    - get guaranteed time off the job to study

    The FE teaching apprenticeship has recently been revised and updated. It is designed to increase the quality of FE teacher training provision. It also lets FE providers access money to fund teacher training.
