  :title: FE providers are independent organisations
  :advice_body: |
    Unlike primary and secondary education, the FE sector is not regulated.

    FE providers like colleges and universities can:

    - set their own requirements in terms of qualifications and experience
    - have their own pay structure and other terms and conditions

    This means that you will need to make your own assessment of any FE provider you consider applying to work for.
