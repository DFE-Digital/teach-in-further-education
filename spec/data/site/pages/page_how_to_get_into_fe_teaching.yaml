  :title: Get a job with a further education provider
  :advice_body: "There is no specific entry path. The usual way is to apply for a
    teaching job with an FE provider. There are no fees to pay.\n\nYou can start work
    as an FE teacher as soon as you get a job with an FE provider. The sort of things
    FE providers look for include:\n\n- knowledge of your subject\n- experience of
    your industry\n- practical skills\n\n[How to apply for an FE teaching job](/find-an-fe-teaching-job.html
    \"Find an FE teaching job\")\n\n### For example\n\nYou've got career experience
    and would like to share it:\n\n1. You apply online for a job in a college to teach
    your subject \n2. After attending an interview, you are offered the job\n3. The
    college arranges and funds your teacher training course\n4. You start teaching
    your subject at the college\n"

    ## This may be the best approach if:

    - you want to start your new career sooner rather than later
    - there is a suitable job available at a local college or training provider
    - you do not want to pay for teacher training yourself

    The provider may support you to study, for example:

    - a teaching qualification
    - a level 5 FE teaching [apprenticeship](https://www.gov.uk/become-apprentice "Gov.uk apprenticeship information")

    [What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels "Explanation of the different educational attainment levels")

    The [FE teaching apprenticeship](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/learning-and-skills-teacher-v1-1 "Learning and skills teaching apprenticeship information") lets FE providers access money to fund teacher training for any subject.

    ## This might not be the right approach if:

    - you want to complete your teacher training first
    - you'd prefer to choose your own teaching qualification
    - you need to do further study or gain more subject knowledge
