      a level 3 qualification in your area of expertise.\n\n[What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
      \"Explanation of the different educational attainment levels\")\n\nIf you can
      show significant industry experience, you still may be able to start teaching
      in FE.\n\n### Subject areas\nThere are too many subject areas to list them all.
