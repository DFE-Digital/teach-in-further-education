  :title: Train as a teacher before you apply for a job
  :advice_body: |-
    You can do your teacher training in your own time around your own commitments.

    Different qualification levels are available. You do not need a degree to teach in FE, but having one gives you more options.

    [Here's a list of popular teacher training courses](/full-list-of-fe-qualifications.html "List of popular teaching courses")

    Once you have qualified you can apply for any suitable jobs.

    ### This may be the best approach if:

    - you want to train around existing commitments
    - you do not want to be tied-in to any one provider once you've qualified
    - you want to get a taste for FE before you commit to teaching in it

    [You may be eligible to apply for a student loan to help pay for the course fees](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance "Student loans")

    ### This might not be the right approach if:

    - you do not want to pay for your teacher training course yourself
    - there is a suitable vacancy at your local college or training provider
    - you're keen to start your new career as soon as a vacancy comes up

  :title: Choose your teaching qualification
  :advice_body: |
    If you want to start teaching in FE before you get a teaching qualification, you do not need to worry about courses.

    The college or training provider will arrange the teacher training course for you.

    If you want to train first, you need to know what training options there are.

    Which course you choose will depend on the:

    - course costs
    - time you can commit
    - expectations of the FE providers you want to work for
    - qualifications you already have

    Some teaching courses allow full or part time study.
