      experience that you can pass on. The minimum experience requirements vary by

      needed for specific teaching roles in FE are set by the colleges and training
      providers.\n\nYou might be able to start work in FE without a teaching qualification.\n\nIf

      a level 3 qualification in your area of expertise.\n\n[What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
      \"Explanation of the different educational attainment levels\")\n\nIf you can
      show significant industry experience, you still may be able to start teaching
      in FE.\n\n### Subject areas\nThere are too many subject areas to list them all.

        John, Lecturer in Plumbing

        ## How did you get into further education teaching?

        I was looking for a change of career after 35 years as a plumber. I'm not getting any younger and I also wanted a break from chasing new business and payments.

        A friend of mine suggested that I teach plumbing at the college she works at, and that's what got me thinking. I did take a month or two off though to do up the house.

        The college were keen to take me on as I already had a professional qualification. I'm doing my teaching qualification in my spare time so that I'll be a qualified teacher by the end of the year.

      :advice_body: "## What does your day look like?\n\nMost of my teaching is done
        in the workshop as mine's a very practical subject.\n\nSome of the work is
        classroom based, like teaching the students how to price up a job and sort
        out their tax.\n\nSome of the classes are in the evening, so my days are quite
        flexible. \n\nApart from that I might be planning a lesson, assessing the
        students' work, or helping a student who's having problems.\n\nThe college
        takes the pastoral stuff very seriously, so we're all expected to help the
        students with any problems they have - in or out of college.\n\nSome days
        can be really busy though, and I do not often leave bang on time.\n\n## What
        do you enjoy about working in further education?\n\nI still feel like I'm
        in the plumbing trade, which is important to me as I've been a plumber since
        I left school.\n\nI like the fact that I'm bringing new people into the trade.
        Some of them didn't do so well with regular school, but I'm giving them the
        chance to go out and earn a living.\n\nBecause I'm teaching now, some of my
        old plumbing mates think I'm a bit of a guru!"
