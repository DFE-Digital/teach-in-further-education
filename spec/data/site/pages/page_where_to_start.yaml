  :title: What is further education?
  :advice_body: |-
    Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:

    - learn a skill or trade
    - study a vocational subject
    - develop their professional career
    - complete post-16 academic studies
    - study as part of an apprenticeship

    As an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults.

    If teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical settings than in a classroom.

  :title: Find out if you could teach in further education
  :advice_body: |-
    There are 2 elements that make a good further education (FE) teacher:

    - skills, knowledge and experience in your subject
    - a teaching qualifiction - or be willing to work towards one

    Ideally you'll have industry experience, preferably with relevant trade qualification. Usually at level 3.

    [What levels mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels "List of academic qualification levels")

    You'll also need good mathematics and English skills. If you do not have GCSEs in mathematics and English, your employer might ask to assess your skills.

    Teaching practice forms part of teacher training, which your college or training provider will support you to do.

    This is not linked to what you want to teach. It's to help you to teach anything your skills, knowledge and experience qualify you to.

    ### You'll need to study teacher training.

    If you need teacher training your new employer will arrange this for you when you start a job with a college or training provider.

    Teacher training courses vary by:

    - what they cost
    - their duration
    - their minimum qualification requirements

  :title: What teaching in further education is like
  :advice_body: |-
    Teaching in FE can be challenging, but also rewarding.

    You'll be passing on your skills, knowledge and experience to improve students' prospects.

    You'll be making a difference to your students' lives, but you'll work hard for it.

    Aside from teaching, you'll mark and assess your students' work.

    You'll be there to support them not just with their learning, but with pastoral issues too.
