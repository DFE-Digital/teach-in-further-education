  :title: What is further education?
  :advice_body: |-
    Further education (FE) is for learners who need to:

    - learn a skill or trade
    - study a vocational subject
    - develop their professional career
    - complete post-16 academic studies
    - study as part of an apprenticeship

    As an FE teacher you could teach a diverse set of learners, including young people and adults.

    If teaching a skill or trade, you'll spend more time in practical settings than in a classroom.

    providers on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n### The average salary for an FE teacher
    ranges from £24,000 to £40,000 \n\nThis is according to National Careers Service

    an idea of your local provider's pay scale by looking at the current jobs on the

  :title: Find out if you could teach in further education
  :advice_body: "Your skills are more valuable than you realise.\n\n### What you need\n\n-
    skills, knowledge and experience in your subject\n- a teaching qualification -
    or the willingness to work towards one\n\nIdeally you'll have industry experience,
    preferably with relevant trade qualification. Usually at level 3.\n\n[What levels
    mean](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels
    \"List of academic qualification levels\")\n\nYou'll also need mathematics and
    English skills. If you do not have GCSEs in mathematics and English, FE providers
    might want to assess your skills. They may support you to improve your mathematics
    and English skills as part of your teacher training.\n\n### Teacher training \n\nThe
    college or training provider will arrange this for you when you start a job with
    them.\n\nThe training is not linked to your subject or skill. It's to help you
    to share your skills, knowledge and experience.\n\nTeacher training courses vary
    by:\n\n- what they cost\n- their duration\n- their minimum qualification requirements\n\n[Find

  :title: What teaching in further education is like
  :advice_body: |-
    Teaching in FE can be challenging, but also rewarding.

    You'll be passing on your skills, knowledge and experience to improve students' prospects.

    You'll be making a difference to your students' lives, but you'll work hard for it.

    Aside from teaching, you'll mark and assess your students' work.

    You'll be there to support them not just with their learning, but with pastoral issues too.
